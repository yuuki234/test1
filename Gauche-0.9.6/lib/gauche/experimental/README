The contents of this directory is for various experiment.
For now, they're mostly syntactic sugars just to make program shorter,
rather than introducing new abstractions.   The merit of such syntactic
sugars is highly subjective, only to be estimated after substantial use
in production code.   These modules are to try them in the real situation.

It is highly possible that, after some periodof trial, we decide to drop
or change some of the stuff here.  Unlike other 'unofficial' modules which
tend to stick if they are around a few years, the stuff here may be changed
even after use of several years.  If you want to use these in your code,
always watch out if something is changed here or not.
