    "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this "
    "continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the "
    "proposition that all men are created equal.  Now we are engaged in a "
    "great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so "
    "conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great "
    "battlefield of that war.  We have come to dedicate a portion of that "
    "field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives "
    "that that nation might live.  It is altogether fitting and proper "
    "that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not "
    "dedicate--we can not consecrate--we can not hallow--this ground.  "
    "The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated "
    "it, far above our poor power to add or detract.  The world will "
    "little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never "
    "forget what they did here.  It is for us the living, rather, to be "
    "dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here "
    "have thus far so nobly advanced.  It is rather for us to be here "
    "dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these "
    "honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they "
    "gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve "
    "that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under "
    "God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the "
    "people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the "
    "earth.  -- President Abraham Lincoln, November 19, 1863"
